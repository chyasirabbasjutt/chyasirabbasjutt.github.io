#### Introduction
I have completed a BSc in Agricultural Engineering at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad. I am working on remote sensing and GIS. I have completed an internship in the Agriculture Remote Sensing Lab hosted by the University of Agriculture Faisalabad. First of all, I learned about the Arc GIS software. I collected soil samples throughout the district of Chiniot in Pakistan. After I determined the  pH and EC of the soil. I made maps on Arc GIS.

#### Research Project
**Geospatial Modeling For Reconstructing High-Resolution (1Km) Groundwater Quality Data- Scarce Agro-Urbanized Regions in Punjab, Pakistan**
- This study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging remote sensing and advanced geospatial models to predict groundwater quality indicators (SAR, RSC, EC) at a fine resolution of 1 km¬≤ in Punjab, Pakistan. The research objectives encompass model development, evaluation, and uncertainty quantification to ensure reliable predictions. In this study, we used machine learning models like SVM, LRM, RF and XGBoost models for prediction results.

**To determine the Ec and pH of District Chiniot by using Arc GIS**

- In this research project to determine the EC and Ph of district Chiniot. Firstly, I collected soil samples of Chiniot and then made maps by Arc GIS.
